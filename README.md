### Project Portfolio

#### 1. Real-World Data Preprocessing: Customer Review Analysis
- **Objective**: To systematically convert unstructured qualitative data (customer reviews) into a clean, structured quantitative dataset suitable for analysis.
- **Outcome**: A well-documented data matrix and coding schema that enables quantitative analysis of customer feedback, which can inform product development and strategy.
- **Skills Applied**: Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing, Categorical Variable Encoding.

#### 2. Foundational Recommendation System: MovieLens
- **Objective**: To build a basic recommender system and evaluate its performance using statistical methods.
- **Outcome**: A functional correlation-based recommender that provides personalized movie suggestions, demonstrating a core concept used in modern consumer platforms.
- **Skills Applied**: Correlation Analysis, Statistical Reasoning, Basic Recommender Systems.

#### 3. Environmental Data Analysis: PM10 Air Pollution Study
- **Objective**: To analyze and interpret air pollution data to identify key trends and regulatory compliance issues.
- **Outcome**: A comprehensive analysis that identified data quality issues (outliers, missing values), visualized pollution distribution, and confirmed the number of days PM10 exceeded legal limits.
- **Skills Applied**: Time-Series Analysis, Data Visualization, Regulatory Compliance Checking.
