    "## Data Coding\n",
    "#### Data coding is the process of converting raw data into a structured format that can be analyzed. This applies to both quantitative and qualitative research. For quantitative data, this often involves assigning numerical values to responses, like coding \"male\" as 0 and \"female\" as 1. For qualitative data, it means assigning labels or tags to text, audio, or video to identify and organize themes and patterns."
